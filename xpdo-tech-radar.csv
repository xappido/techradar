Bash,adopt,Languages and Frameworks,TRUE,"<a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/'>Bash</a> is our default choice for scripting internal tools. Everyone should be familiar with the Bash toolkit."
.NET 6,adopt,Languages and Frameworks,TRUE,"<a href='https://dotnet.microsoft.com/'>.NET 6</a> is in Long Term Support (LTS). It is cross-platform and a great choice for desktop, web and cloud-based applications."
ASP.NET Core,adopt,Languages and Frameworks,TRUE,"<a href='https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet'>ASP.NET</a>."
Blazor.Net,assess,Languages and Frameworks,TRUE,"<a href='https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor'>Blazor</a> is super exciting. It means we might get to leverage our existing C# skills in the browser. It's too early for Redgate to commit to using this in production, so it's in assess so we can keep a good understanding of developments in this area."
Visual Studio,adopt,Tools,TRUE,"Visual Studio is our default IDE for developing in C#. We get the Enterprise edition via our MSDN subscription."
Rider,adopt,Tools,TRUE,"Many teams use Rider instead of Visual Studio for their development. We have licences for it."
VS Code,adopt,Tools,TRUE,"A free lightweight IDE. Our text editor of choice."
Azure DevOps,adopt,Tools,TRUE,"We expect Microsoft will prioritize GitHub Actions over Azure DevOps for future development, so Azure DevOps is not recommended for new projects."

Windows Azure,adopt,Platforms,TRUE,""
CLIs,adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Product should, where possible, expose funtionality via a CLI."
RESTful APIs,adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"A REST architetural style is our default choice for building web APIs. Deviations can be made when it makes sense to do so."

Infrastructure as code,adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Infrastructure should be provisioned through code rather than manually (except for ad-hoc testing)"
Automated code style settings,adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Codebases should be formatted consistently. Automated code-style settings achieve this without fuss."
Static code analysis (linters),adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Static code analysis is invaluable for automatically checking for problems in code. We use ESLint for JS and Roslyn-based analyzers for .NET. We also experimented with SonarQube but our implementation wasn't giving us confidence."
Semantic Versioning,adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"We should use semver for all our versioning needs unless there's a compelling reason not to."
Database Agnosticism,adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"We aim for feature parity between products that support different database engines."
Continuous delivery,adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Products should be ready for release at any time."
Continuous Deployment,assess,Techniques,TRUE,"We'd like to evaluate technology that increases our deployment frequency, with a view to getting value into the hands of our users as quickly as possible."
